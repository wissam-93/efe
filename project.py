Columns description

anaemia     :Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)

creatinine_phosphokinase:   Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)

diabetes:    If the patient has diabetes (boolean)

ejection_fraction:   Ejection fraction (EF) is a measurement, 
expressed as a percentage, of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction

high_blood_pressure:  blood hypertension

platelets   : component of blood whose function (along with the coagulation factors)

serum_creatinine:   Serum creatinine is widely interpreted as a measure only of renal function

serum_sodium: to see how much sodium is in your blood it is particularly important for nerve and muscle function.



Sex - Gender of patient Male = 1, Female =0
Age - Age of patient
Diabetes - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
Anaemia - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
High_blood_pressure - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
Smoking - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
DEATH_EVENT - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
